### Go template
# If you prefer the allow list template instead of the deny list, see community template:
# https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/community/Golang/Go.AllowList.gitignore
#
# Binaries for programs and plugins
*.exe
*.exe~
*.dll
*.so
*.dylib

# Test binary, built with `go test -c`
*.test

# Output of the go coverage tool, specifically when used with LiteIDE
*.out

# Dependency directories (remove the comment below to include it)
# vendor/

# Go workspace file
go.work

### Go.AllowList template
# Allowlisting gitignore template for GO projects prevents us
# from adding various unwanted local files, such as generated
# files, developer configurations or IDE-specific files etc.
#
# Recommended: Go.AllowList.gitignore

# Ignore everything
*

# But not these files...
!/.gitignore

!*.go
!go.sum
!go.mod

!README.md
!LICENSE

# !Makefile

# ...even if they are in subdirectories
!*/
